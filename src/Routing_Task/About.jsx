         <h2 className="fs-5  mt-4 about_design">Humanity has always turned to excellence as a flower turns towards the sun. 
           Quality thus perceived, is <br/>an abiding interest in, and a desire to develop,
                 whatever is regarded as excellent in Arts, scholarly pursuits <br/>of Sciences, Engineering, 
                Technology, and Humanities.
               The need to educate and train young men and women,<br/> to hone them into
                professionally competent, rounded personalities has been our burning passion.<br/>It was Richard Mulcaster of Elizabethan England who declared:
                <br/> “It is not a mind, not a body that we have to cultivate, but a man, and we cannot divide him”.</h2>
